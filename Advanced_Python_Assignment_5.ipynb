Let's say you have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. You can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method you're interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x.\n","\n","- The delegation is accomplished via the **getattr** method; consult the language reference for more information about controlling attribute access."],"metadata":{"id":"o5NlKF8yP9Vu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q3.

A class that references to one or more objects of other classes as an Instance variable. Here, by using the class name or by creating the object we can access the members of one class inside another class. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of different classes. It means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component. This type of relationship is known as Has-A Relation."],"metadata":{"id":"RcftYeitQIi7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Q4.
